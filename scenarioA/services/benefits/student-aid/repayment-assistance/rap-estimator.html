		<strong>Interest Rate</strong></p>

		<p>Please enter the interest rate as indicated on your loan consolidation papers or on your latest loan statement.</p>

		<p>If you have not signed your loan consolidation papers yet, your loan will automatically be consolidated 6-months after your study period has ended.  You will then be sent your consolidation papers which will summarize the total amount you owe, the amortization period and the interest rate.  Interest rates will either be floating (prime rate + 2.5%) or fixed (prime rate at the time of consolidation + 5%).  For the purpose of this estimator you can also simply input the current prime rate (+ 2.5% for floating and +5% for fixed rates) from the <a title="Bank of Canada Web site" href="http://www.bankofcanada.ca/en/rates/digest.html">Bank of Canada Web site.</a></p>

		<p><strong>Why is this asked for?</strong></p>

		<p>Your interest rate is used to determine your monthly loan payments which are used to calculate your eligibility.
