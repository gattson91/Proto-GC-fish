## Repo for Student Loans optimization prototyping project
A collaboration between TBS Digital Transformation Office and Employment and Social Development Canada

This repo holds a prototyped version of a new task-based design for Canada Student Loans to improve citizen success. The targets for this project are to improve user success by at least 20 percentage points at finding the right pages for answers to top student loan questions and at deriving the correct answers to the questions. 

A baseline round of task-scenario testing on the live version of Canada.ca in the spring of 2018 highlighted critical usability problems. Working together as a collaborative team across the departments, we will design and implement solutions in these prototype pages. A second round of validation testing with a different set of Canadian participants is planned for early November. Participants in that study will use this prototype rather than the live site, to test that the success rates are improved.

To try out the prototyped pages, start from this updated Canada.ca home page, and follow the paths via Jobs, Benefits, Youth or Money and Finances:
